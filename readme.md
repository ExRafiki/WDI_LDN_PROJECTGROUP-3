<span style="color:red">##GA PROJECT NUMBER 3:</span>

###Goal:

For this project we were put into teams and given the task to design and collaboratively build a MEAN stack app of our own design. Our response to that brief was Moodify.

Building an application using version controllers as well as Github to deliver the project in 1 week.The choice to focus on an API heavy application using facial recognition and music was a team vision and came up naturally after dabbling with a range of ideas.

#####TEAM:

Elliot Yandzio - Filippos Antoniadis - Bridget Turnbull

###Languages used:

* HTML5
* JavaScript
* SCSS
* AngularJS
* Node JS

###Released on

* Github
* Heroku

##Name - MOODIFY

The goal was set to create an application to take your facial cue process it and delivery you with a Spotify playlist based on that cue.

##Process

###Research

I started with searching all basic games available on Appstore or small game websites.
While searching , i found out that battleship has been done over and over , but following the traditional
concept which is player 1 and player 2 fighting each other.I could not find a game
that had the RNG(RandomNumberGeneration) factor to it which adds re-playability.

###Development

* 1 -Using other battleship game structures i set up a general javascript structure that
game a certain logic to the concept.
* 2 -Working slowing on the game logic i set up ship generation then added the horizontal/
vertical.
* 3 -Spend 2 days figuring the array positioning as well as making it "true" RNG so
no one pattern is the same

###Lessons learned:

*  Proper user of multi-branch development
*  Teamwork as a developer.
*  Conflict solving within the same code base.
*  Use of complex external APIS.
*  Use of SDKs.

###Challenges

*  Spotify OAuth that was tackled by Bridget and requires a lot of documentation reading and try/error to get functional.
*  FileStack integration with camera that was being blocked by browser.
making me waste a lot of time trying to change the data-attribute.
*  Display of the minimalistic style had to be on point otherwise looking unfinished.

###Goals achieved

- [X] Make the application that we envisioned.
- [X] Creating a fun experience for the user.
- [X] Merging 3 APIS together in a cohesive manner.
- [ ] <span style="color:red">Favoriting playlist / customizable playlist result based on user preferences.</span>

###Future Features

* The future idea that we would like to be implemented would be : management of favorite playlists.
